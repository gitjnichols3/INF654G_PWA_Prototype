# INF654G_PWA_Prototype
Prototype of gig tracker application that tracks the performances of family musicians.

Project Description

Overview - 
The app is a gig tracker for my two adult kids who are musicians. The idea is to add a page to the app each time they perform that includes the name, location, date, photos and any other details or narrative about the performance.

How to navigate - View each page from the nav bar. On the zoe and cooper pages, click each performance card to view details about the performance.

Pages
- index.html - is a splash page with a general greeting and welcome.
- zoe.html - features a brief artist bio on Zoe Nichols and includes a list of performances in reverse chronological order that serve as hyperlinks to separate pages - 1 for each performance - that each include details and specifics about that gig, including pictures. For now, most of the images and text are placeholder content throughout the site.
- cooper.html - features a brief artist bio on Cooper Nichols and includes a list of performances in reverse chronological order that serve as hyperlinks to separate pages - 1 for each performance - that each include details and specifics about that gig, including pictures. For now, most of the images and text are placeholder content throughout the site.
- p1.html - standing for performance 1, this page is a placeholder representing each of the detailed gig pages. The idea is that you'll be able to click on any gig in the list for either of the artists and pull up a detailed write up of that concert.
- contact.html - this is a contact page with social media links for each artist and a contact form. Currently, the form placeholder doesn't submit.
